# Capstone

## About
What's Due is an API built with Nodejs, Express and MongoDb and was deployed using AWS. It is the endpoint for the React Native app [Due: Early](https://github.com/SSBinks/dueEarly). This app is targeted toward young adults studying at the tertiary level and beyond to help them track progress on specific tasks and automatically sets daily or weekly goals for the user.

## Problem Statement
There are a wide variety of mobile apps that help people organize, track and complete tasks and a few that specifically target students with homework, exams and other school specific tasks. However, most of these applications are created for students attending secondary institutions and can be quite rigid in terms of tracking class schedules, types of subjects one may take and how frequently assignments may be assigned. The aim of my mobile application is to assist students who are attending post-secondary or tertiary institutions keep track of progress on their assignments and progress throughout the duration of their study of project. The application will avoid being as rigid as some homework applications and yet will be more focused than general apps that track tasks.


## Market Research
### Alternative Mobile Apps
**My student Life**:

_Description_: My Student Life is a mobile app and web application which assists students in tracking their homework, and upcoming exams. Overall this app has positive reviews. Users are able to login as teachers or students. As a student I can track my classes, homework and exam schedule and it will sync data across platforms. The app sends reminders of unfinished tasks, upcoming exams.

_Limitations_: From the online reviews in the app store, users are limited when it comes to setting up non-traditional classes (like online classes, or courses on a non-traditional schedule. The app only likes tasks (like homework or  exams) to a specific class. There are also a few complaints about the ability to change or delete an instance of a class (i.e your class is cancelled) and a lack of flexibility on personalizing notifications.

**myHomework Student Planner**:

_Description_: This application is available on mobile and as a web application. It allows students to track their homework and see progress as they complete certain tasks for certain classes.

_Limitation_: Users complained of not being able to add additional reminders. There were also suggestions of a skip function as to not delete assignment but rather opt out of notifications. You were not able to prioritize assignments. The biggest complaints recently was that there were more adds which were distracting.

**Evernote**:

_Description_: This note taking application works across several platforms and syncs the data. It allows users to organize information and can be used in the same way as the other applications.

_Limitations_: There seems to be complaints about formatting fonts and heading and being able to customize those (this may just be the free version). A recent upgrade has seemed to cause some issues with how fast everything syncs together.

### Differentiation With My Application
Due to the time constraint and the main goal of my application, I do not believe I will be able to address all the limitations that other users have found with other applications. I do want to make my mobile application more flexible when it comes to creating tasks that fall outside of a certain course. This would affect the relationship between courses and tasks. I would also want to make the way that courses occur and are scheduled to be flexible to accommodate a variety of institutions. Notifications would not only remind the user of when something is due but would also let them know their progress.

## Users of My App
My user attends a post-secondary institution. The reason for this is that there tends to be more assignments that need to be worked on throughout a longer period of time rather than in an evening or over a weekend. For example, a student may only have four papers due throughout a term, but wouldnâ€™t necessarily need or want to track their final paper until a certain point in the semester. My user may also be taking online or remote courses  so the scheduling of the actual class versus when things are due might be different.

## Proposed Technologies
